The word asemic / eɪ ˈ s iː m ɪ k / means \"having no specific semantic content\", or \"without the smallest unit of meaning\".  With the non-specificity of asemic writing there comes a vacuum of meaning, which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret. All of this is similar to the way one would deduce meaning from an abstract work of art . Where asemic writing distinguishes itself among traditions of abstract art is in the asemic author\\'s use of gestural constraint, and the retention of physical characteristics of writing such as lines and symbols. Asemic writing is a hybrid art form that fuses text and image into a unity, and then sets it free to arbitrary subjective interpretations. It may be compared to free writing or writing for its own sake, instead of writing to produce verbal context. The open nature of asemic works allows for meaning to occur across linguistic understanding; an asemic text may be \"read\" in a similar fashion regardless of the reader\\'s natural language.  Multiple meanings for the same symbolism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic writing can be polysemantic or have zero meaning, infinite meanings, or its meaning can evolve over time.  Asemic works leave for the reader to decide how to translate and explore an asemic text; in this sense, the reader becomes co-creator of the asemic work.', \"Asha Bhosle [ note 1 ] ( Marathi pronunciation: [ˈaːʃaː ˈbʱos(ə)le] ; née Mangeshkar ; born 8 September 1933) is an Indian playback singer , entrepreneur, actress and television personality who predominantly works in Indian cinema .

Jainism traces its spiritual ideas and history through the succession of twenty-four tirthankara s : supreme preachers of dharma . The first tirthankara in the current time cycle is Rishabhadeva , who tradition holds lived millions of years ago; the twenty-third tirthankara is Parshvanatha , traditionally dated to the 9th century BCE ; and the twenty-fourth tirthankara is Mahavira , who lived around the 6th or 5th BCE. Jainism is considered an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every time cycle of the cosmology . Central to understanding Jain philosophy is the concept of bhedavijñāna , or the clear distinction in the nature of the soul and non-soul entities. This principle underscores the innate purity and potential for liberation within every soul , distinct from the physical and mental elements that bind it to the cycle of birth and rebirth . Recognizing and internalizing this separation is essential for spiritual progress and the attainment of samyaka darśana or self realization , which marks the beginning of the aspirant's journey towards liberation .\", \"Georg Jakob Felsing (22 July 1802, Darmstadt - 9 June 1883, Darmstadt) was a German line-engraver .

Much of the literary record of Japanese poetry begins when Japanese poets encountered Chinese poetry during the Tang dynasty (although the Chinese classic anthology of poetry, Shijing , was well known by the literati of Japan by the 6th century). Under the influence of the Chinese poets of this era Japanese began to compose poetry in Chinese ( kanshi ); and, as part of this tradition, poetry in Japan tended to be intimately associated with pictorial painting, partly because of the influence of Chinese arts, and the tradition of the use of ink and brush for both writing and drawing. It took several hundred years [ citation needed ] to digest the foreign impact and make it an integral part of Japanese culture and to merge this kanshi poetry into a Japanese language literary tradition, and then later to develop the diversity of unique poetic forms of native poetry, such as waka , haikai , and other more Japanese poetic specialties.

The estate is first mentioned by the Burgundian King Rudolf III around 1010, but he lists his father as the builder of the estate.  Very little is known about this first castle, except that it consisted of a circular wooden wall with several wooden buildings inside the wall.  Around 1260  or between 1250 and 1270 a round stone tower was built in the center of the site.  This round tower was quite unusual for Bernese castles but may indicate a savoyard influence.  Since Peter II of Savoy held authority over Bern at the time, it is likely, but not confirmed, that the round tower was built as a symbol of Savoy's power.  The tower had an outer diameter of 9.3\\xa0m (31\\xa0ft) and a thickness of about 2\\xa0m (6.6\\xa0ft).  It probably rose about 10–15\\xa0m (33–49\\xa0ft) high.

Shortly after the construction of the tower, the wooden wall was replaced with a stone wall and a half-round tower was added to protect the wall.

While paleontological observations are known from at least the 6th century BC , the foundation of paleontology as a science dates back to the work of Georges Cuvier in 1796 . Cuvier demonstrated evidence for the concept of extinction and how life of the past was not necessarily the same as that of the present.

As a leading figure in the development of Neo-Confucianism , Zhu Xi played a pivotal role in shaping the intellectual foundations of later imperial China.

He advanced a rigorous philosophical methodology known as the \"investigation of things\" ( 格物 ) and emphasized meditation as an essential practice for moral and intellectual self-cultivation. Zhu Xi\\'s thought exerted profound influence, becoming the official state ideology of China from the Yuan dynasty onward, and was later adopted in other East Asian countries such as Japan , Korea , and Vietnam .
